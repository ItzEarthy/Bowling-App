# Achievement System Implementation

## Overview
A complete achievement tracking system has been implemented that automatically checks games for completed achievements and displays animated popup notifications when achievements are earned.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Achievement Handler (`achievementHandler.js`)**
**Location:** `frontend/src/utils/achievementHandler.js`

A centralized achievement management system that:
- Initializes with user data from the backend
- Automatically processes completed games
- Checks all achievement conditions
- Saves newly earned achievements to the backend
- Manages achievement state in localStorage
- Provides listeners for real-time notifications
- Tracks user stats and streaks across sessions

**Key Features:**
- `initialize(userId)` - Loads user achievements from backend
- `processGame(gameData)` - Checks a game against all achievements
- `addListener(callback)` - Subscribe to achievement events
- `saveNewAchievements(achievements)` - Persists to backend API
- `getStats()` - Retrieve current achievement statistics

---

### 2. **Achievement Toast Notification (`AchievementToast.jsx`)**
**Location:** `frontend/src/components/ui/AchievementToast.jsx`

Beautiful animated popup notifications that appear when achievements are earned:
- Gradient background with sparkle animations
- Bouncing trophy icon
- Achievement details (name, description, icon, rarity, points)
- Auto-dismisses after 8 seconds
- Supports multiple toasts in a queue with staggered animations
- Smooth slide-in/slide-out transitions

**Components:**
- `AchievementToast` - Individual toast component
- `AchievementToastContainer` - Manages multiple toasts and listens for events

---

### 3. **Backend Database Schema Updates**
**Location:** `backend/src/db/database.js`

Added `user_achievements` table to store earned achievements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_achievements (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  achievement_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_earned TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  progress INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  UNIQUE(user_id, achievement_id),
  FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

Includes indexes for optimal query performance.

---

### 4. **Backend API Endpoints**
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/users.js`

Two new endpoints for achievement management:

#### GET `/api/users/me/achievements`
- Returns all achievements earned by the current user
- Includes achievement_id, date_earned, and progress

#### POST `/api/users/me/achievements`
- Saves a newly earned achievement
- Prevents duplicate entries
- Body: `{ achievement_id, date_earned }`

---

### 5. **App Integration (`App.jsx`)**
**Location:** `frontend/src/App.jsx`

The main App component now:
- Imports and displays `AchievementToastContainer`
- Initializes the `achievementHandler` when user logs in
- Sets up event listeners for achievement notifications
- Dispatches custom events to trigger toast notifications

---

### 6. **Game Store Integration (`gameStore.js`)**
**Location:** `frontend/src/stores/gameStore.js`

Updated the game completion flow:
- Imports `achievementHandler` instead of `AchievementEngine`
- Calls `achievementHandler.processGame()` when games complete
- Calculates game stats (strikes, spares, opens) automatically
- Returns achievement results along with streak data
- Achievements are checked for all entry modes (pin-by-pin, frame-by-frame, final score)

---

### 7. **Achievements Page Updates (`AchievementsPage.jsx`)**
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/AchievementsPage.jsx`

Enhanced to work with the new system:
- Uses `achievementHandler` instead of creating new engine instances
- Listens for `achievementEarned` events to refresh in real-time
- Processes all user games on load to ensure achievements are up to date
- Displays live progress and statistics from the handler

---

## How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
Game Completed
    ‚Üì
gameStore.processCompletedGame()
    ‚Üì
achievementHandler.processGame(gameData)
    ‚Üì
[Check all 100+ achievement conditions]
    ‚Üì
New achievements found?
    ‚Üì YES
achievementHandler.saveNewAchievements()
    ‚Üì
POST /api/users/me/achievements (backend saves)
    ‚Üì
achievementHandler.notifyListeners()
    ‚Üì
window.dispatchEvent('achievementEarned')
    ‚Üì
AchievementToastContainer receives event
    ‚Üì
AchievementToast displayed with animation! üéâ
```

---

## Achievement Types Supported

The system currently supports **100+ achievements** across 10 categories:

1. **Scoring** - Score milestones (100, 150, 200, 250, 300)
2. **Consistency** - Maintaining averages over time
3. **Special** - Unique patterns and rare occurrences
4. **Streaks** - Consecutive strikes, spares, improving games
5. **Milestones** - Games played, pins knocked, perfect games
6. **Social** - Friends, leaderboards, challenges
7. **Equipment** - Ball arsenal and maintenance
8. **Dedication** - Practice hours, session length
9. **Mastery** - Advanced techniques and patterns
10. **Perfection** - Perfect games and clean games

---

## Testing the System

1. **Rebuild Docker containers** to apply database changes:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Complete a game** using any entry mode
3. **Watch for popup notifications** when achievements are earned
4. **Visit Achievements page** to see your progress
5. **Complete more games** to unlock additional achievements

- Achievements are checked against the latest game data on every page load
- The notification system supports multiple simultaneous toasts with staggered animations
- All 100+ achievement definitions are located in `frontend/src/data/achievements.js`

## Issues Fixed

While implementing the achievement system, the following bug was also fixed:
- ‚úÖ Fixed `pinCarryAnalyzer.recordFirstBall is not a function` error by adding missing methods to the PinCarryAnalyzer class

---

## Summary

The achievement system is now fully functional! Games are automatically checked for achievements, earned achievements are saved to the database, and beautiful popup notifications appear when you unlock them. The Achievements page displays real-time progress and all earned achievements with detailed statistics.

Enjoy tracking your bowling accomplishments! üé≥üèÜ
