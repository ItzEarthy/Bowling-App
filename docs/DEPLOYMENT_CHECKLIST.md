## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Review
- [ ] Review all modified files:
  - [ ] `frontend/vite.config.js` - Service worker configuration
  - [ ] `frontend/src/stores/authStore.js` - Authentication state management
  - [ ] `frontend/src/lib/api.js` - API client with interceptors
  - [ ] `frontend/src/App.jsx` - App initialization
  - [ ] `frontend/src/registerSW.js` - Service worker registration

- [ ] Review all new files:
  - [ ] `frontend/public/sw-custom.js` - Custom service worker extensions
  - [ ] `frontend/src/utils/cacheManager.js` - Cache management utility

- [ ] Review documentation:
  - [ ] `docs/PWA_AUTH_BUG_FIX.md` - Complete analysis
  - [ ] `docs/PWA_AUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - User guide
  - [ ] `docs/PWA_AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
  - [ ] `docs/PWA_AUTH_VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - Visual diagrams

### Build Test
- [ ] Clean build directory
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  rm -rf dist
  ```

- [ ] Install dependencies (if needed)
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- [ ] Run development build
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- [ ] Verify no build errors
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript/ESLint errors

### Local Testing

#### Test 1: Normal Login/Logout
- [ ] Open browser in incognito mode
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:8031
- [ ] Log in with valid credentials
- [ ] Verify successful login
- [ ] Navigate to protected routes
- [ ] Log out
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Log in again
- [ ] Verify successful re-login

#### Test 2: Cache Clearing
- [ ] Log in
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cache Storage
- [ ] Note number of caches
- [ ] Log out
- [ ] Verify all caches cleared (or significantly reduced)
- [ ] Open Console
- [ ] Look for `[CACHE] All caches cleared` log

#### Test 3: Token Expiration Simulation
- [ ] Log in
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
- [ ] Run this command:
  ```javascript
  // Backup current token
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  const parts = token.split('.');
  const payload = JSON.parse(atob(parts[1]));
  console.log('Current expiry:', new Date(payload.exp * 1000));
  
  // Note: Real testing requires natural expiration or backend modification
  // For now, just verify the token is valid
  console.log('Token is valid:', payload.exp * 1000 > Date.now());
  ```
- [ ] Close and reopen the app
- [ ] Verify token validation runs on app load
- [ ] Look for `[AUTH] Token validation on init` log

#### Test 4: Service Worker Behavior
- [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Filter by "auth"
- [ ] Log in with valid credentials
- [ ] Verify `/auth/login` request shows:
  - Size: (from disk cache) ‚ùå NOT THIS!
  - Size: actual response size ‚úÖ THIS!
- [ ] Verify auth requests always hit the network

#### Test 5: Error Recovery
- [ ] Try logging in with invalid credentials
- [ ] Verify error message displays
- [ ] Verify caches were cleared (check DevTools)
- [ ] Try logging in with valid credentials
- [ ] Verify successful login

### Console Log Verification
- [ ] Verify these logs appear during login:
  ```
  [AUTH] Login attempt { identifier: "..." }
  [CACHE] Clearing all caches { reason: "pre_login" }
  [API] API Request { method: "POST", url: "/auth/login" }
  [API] API Response { method: "POST", url: "/auth/login", status: 200 }
  [AUTH] Login successful { userId: X, username: "..." }
  ```

- [ ] Verify these logs appear during logout:
  ```
  [AUTH] User logout { userId: X, username: "..." }
  [CACHE] Clearing all caches { reason: "logout" }
  ```

### Browser Compatibility Testing
- [ ] Test in Chrome
- [ ] Test in Firefox
- [ ] Test in Edge
- [ ] Test in Safari (if available)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Check dist/ directory was created
- [ ] Verify service worker file exists: `dist/sw.js`
- [ ] Verify manifest file exists: `dist/manifest.webmanifest`

### Step 2: Docker Build (if using Docker)
```bash
cd ..
docker-compose build frontend
```

- [ ] Frontend image builds successfully
- [ ] No build errors or warnings

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Stop existing containers
docker-compose down

# Start with new build
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

- [ ] Frontend container starts successfully
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] nginx serves the app correctly

### Step 4: Staging Testing
- [ ] Access staging URL
- [ ] Run through all local tests again
- [ ] Verify service worker updates automatically
- [ ] Check Network tab for proper request handling
- [ ] Verify cache behavior
- [ ] Test login/logout cycles

### Step 5: Production Deployment
```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/Bowling-App

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Build and deploy
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend backend
```

- [ ] Production containers running
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] App accessible at production URL

---

## üìä Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (Within 1 Hour)
- [ ] Access production URL
- [ ] Service worker updates automatically
- [ ] Login works for new users
- [ ] Logout works correctly
- [ ] Re-login works after logout

### Monitor for 24 Hours
- [ ] Check error logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs --tail=100 backend | grep ERROR
  docker-compose logs --tail=100 frontend | grep ERROR
  ```

- [ ] Check authentication logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs --tail=100 backend | grep "[AUTH]"
  ```

- [ ] Monitor user reports
- [ ] Check analytics (if available)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero reports of "cannot log in"
- [ ] Zero reports of "need to uninstall"
- [ ] No auth-related errors in logs
- [ ] Users can log in after session expiration

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Users Report Issues

#### Issue: "Still can't log in"
**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Have user run this in console
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
console.log('Has token:', !!token);

if (token) {
  const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
  console.log('Token expires:', new Date(payload.exp * 1000));
  console.log('Is expired:', Date.now() > payload.exp * 1000);
}
```

**Fix:**
1. Clear localStorage
2. Clear all caches
3. Refresh page
4. Try logging in again

#### Issue: "Service worker not updating"
**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Check SW registration
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(reg => {
  console.log('SW state:', reg?.active?.state);
  console.log('SW URL:', reg?.active?.scriptURL);
});
```

**Fix:**
1. Force service worker update
2. Unregister old service worker
3. Refresh page

#### Issue: "Auth requests being cached"
**Diagnosis:**
- Check Network tab
- Look for "from disk cache" or "from service worker"
- Should see actual network requests

**Fix:**
1. Verify vite.config.js has NetworkOnly for /auth/**
2. Clear all caches
3. Refresh page
4. Try again

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

**Step 1: Immediate Rollback**
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Checkout previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Rebuild and deploy
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 2: Notify Users**
- Post announcement about temporary rollback
- Provide timeline for fix
- Give workaround instructions

**Step 3: Investigate**
- Review logs
- Identify specific issue
- Test fix locally
- Re-deploy when ready

---

## üìà Success Criteria

### The fix is successful if:

**Week 1:**
- [ ] Zero uninstall/reinstall reports
- [ ] No auth lockout issues
- [ ] Clean logs with no auth errors
- [ ] Users can log in after session expiration

**Week 2-4:**
- [ ] Sustained zero lockout issues
- [ ] Positive user feedback
- [ ] No cache-related problems
- [ ] Service worker operating correctly

---

## üìù Communication Plan

### User Announcement (After Successful Deployment)

**Subject:** Important Update: Authentication Improvements

**Message:**
```
Hi Bowling App users!

We've deployed an important update that fixes an issue some users 
experienced with logging in after being away from the app for a while.

What's Fixed:
‚úÖ You can now log in successfully after your session expires
‚úÖ No more need to uninstall and reinstall the app
‚úÖ Smoother authentication experience overall

What You'll Notice:
‚Ä¢ Your app will update automatically
‚Ä¢ You may see a brief "updating" notification
‚Ä¢ Everything else works the same

If You're Currently Locked Out:
You'll need to uninstall and reinstall ONE MORE TIME. After this 
update, you'll never need to do that again!

Questions? Contact support or check our troubleshooting guide:
[Link to PWA_AUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md]

Thanks for your patience!
- The Bowling App Team
```
