# Frame by Frame Entry - UI/UX Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Top Frame Selection Box
**Before:** Separate card with frame selection grid at the top
**After:** Frame selection integrated into the Game Summary section at the bottom

- Total score moved to header card with gradient background
- Header shows: Title, subtitle, and prominent total score display
- Frame navigation now in "Frame Navigation" section below throws

### 2. ✅ Strike Button Only Green After Selection
**Before:** Strike button was always green (green-50 bg, green-400 border)
**After:** Strike button highlights green only when selected

- **Unselected state:** `border-green-400 bg-green-50 text-green-800` (light green)
- **Selected state:** `border-green-500 bg-green-500 text-white` (solid green)
- Same pattern applied to Spare button (blue variants)
- Gutter and Half buttons use charcoal colors when selected

### 3. ✅ Selected Number Highlights Instead of Disappearing
**Before:** Selected number disappeared or wasn't clearly highlighted
**After:** Selected number shows with red highlight

- **Selected:** `bg-vintage-red-600 text-white border-vintage-red-700 shadow`
- **Unselected:** `bg-white text-charcoal-800 border-charcoal-300`
- Number remains visible and clearly highlighted
- All numbers 1-10 (or available pins) shown in grid

### 4. ✅ Next Throw Hidden Until Score Entered
**Before:** All throws shown simultaneously
**After:** Progressive disclosure - only show throws as needed

#### Frames 1-9:
- **1st throw:** Always visible
- **2nd throw:** Only visible after 1st throw has a value
- If 1st throw is a strike (10), automatically moves to next frame on confirm

#### Frame 10:
- **1st throw:** Always visible
- **2nd throw:** Only visible after 1st throw has a value
- **3rd throw:** Only visible if:
  - 1st throw was a strike (10), OR
  - 2nd throw was a spare (1st + 2nd = 10), OR
  - 2nd throw was a strike (10)

### 5. ✅ Reworked Frame 10 Entry Logic
**Before:** Always showed 3 throws for frame 10
**After:** Smart progressive disclosure based on scoring rules

#### Strike Button Visibility on Throw 2:
- **Frames 1-9 throw 2:** Spare button shown instead of Strike (unless it's frame 10)
- **Frame 10 throw 1:** Strike button shown
- **Frame 10 throw 2:** 
  - If throw 1 was a strike → Strike button shown
  - If throw 1 was NOT a strike → Spare button shown instead
- **Frame 10 throw 3:** Strike button shown (if throw 3 is visible)

#### Third Throw Logic:
```javascript
// Show throw 3 only if:
const shouldShowThrow3 = 
  firstThrow === 10 ||                          // Strike on first throw
  (secondThrow !== undefined && 
   (firstThrow + secondThrow === 10 ||          // Spare
    secondThrow === 10));                       // Strike on second throw
```

### 6. ✅ Confirmation Button Instead of Auto-Advance
**Before:** Automatically advanced to next frame/throw after selection
**After:** User must click "Confirm" button to advance

#### Confirm Button Features:
- Only appears when a value is selected for current throw
- Shows descriptive text: "Confirm Strike", "Confirm Gutter", "Confirm 7 Pins", etc.
- Uses full width of throw container
- Green color with white text
- On confirm:
  - Frames 1-9 throw 1 (strike): Advances to next frame
  - Frames 1-9 throw 2: Advances to next frame
  - Frame 10: Only advances when appropriate based on scoring rules

## Visual Improvements

### Header Card
```jsx
<Card className="bg-gradient-to-r from-vintage-red-50 to-mint-green-50">
  <CardContent className="p-4">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <div>
        <h2>Frame by Frame Entry</h2>
        <p>Enter throws for each frame</p>
      </div>
      <div className="text-right">
        <div>Total Score</div>
        <div className="text-3xl font-bold">{totalScore}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Quick Action Buttons (New Design)
- Gutter: Gray/charcoal colors
- Strike: Green (only when selected)
- Spare: Blue (only when selected)
- Half: Gray/charcoal colors
- All buttons use `active:scale-95` for touch feedback

### Number Grid
- 5-column grid for consistent layout

- Unselected: White background with charcoal border
- Hover states for better feedback
