# Split System & Pin Diagram Updates - October 1, 2025

## Summary
Three major improvements to the split detection system and pin visualization based on user feedback.

---

## Change #1: ✅ Pin Diagram Orientation Fixed

### Issue
- Pin diagram had pin 1 at top and pins 7-10 at bottom
- Pins didn't look like actual bowling pins (simple shapes)

### Solution

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/ui/PinDiagram.jsx`

#### A. Flipped Pin Layout
- **Before**: Pin 1 at top (y: 10), Pins 7-10 at bottom (y: 46)
- **After**: Pin 1 at bottom (y: 55), Pins 7-10 at top (y: 19)

```javascript
// NEW - Correct bowling lane perspective
const pinPositions = {
  1: { x: 50, y: 55, row: 1 },   // Head pin (closest to bowler)
  2: { x: 40, y: 43, row: 2 },
  3: { x: 60, y: 43, row: 2 },
  4: { x: 30, y: 31, row: 3 },
  5: { x: 50, y: 31, row: 3 },
  6: { x: 70, y: 31, row: 3 },
  7: { x: 20, y: 19, row: 4 },   // Back pins (furthest from bowler)
  8: { x: 40, y: 19, row: 4 },
  9: { x: 60, y: 19, row: 4 },
  10: { x: 80, y: 19, row: 4 }
};
```

#### B. Improved Pin Shape
- **Before**: Simple path with basic curves
- **After**: Realistic bowling pin shape with proper proportions

**New SVG Path Features:**
- Rounded top (head)
- Narrow neck
- Wider body
- Flared base
- Uses Cubic Bézier curves (C) for smooth transitions

```svg
<path d="
  M x y-7                           /* Top of pin */
  C ... (narrow neck)
  L ... (body)
  C ... (wider base)
  L ... (flat bottom)
  Z                                 /* Close path */
"/>
```

#### C. Pin Number Position
- **Before**: Pin numbers above pins
- **After**: Pin numbers below pins (y + 10)
- **Reason**: Better visibility with flipped layout

### Visual Comparison

```
BEFORE:                    AFTER:
   1 (top)                7 8 9 10 (top/far)
  2 3                      4 5 6
 4 5 6                      2 3
7 8 9 10 (bottom)            1 (bottom/near)
```

## Change #2: ✅ Split Popup Dismisses on New Frame

### Issue
- Split notification remained visible when moving to next frame
- Could clutter the UI during gameplay

### Solution

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/components/features/PinByPinEntry.jsx`

Added a useEffect hook that listens for the `bowlingFrameChanged` event and automatically dismisses the split advice popup:

```javascript
// Listen for frame changes and dismiss split advice popup
useEffect(() => {
  const handleFrameChange = () => {
    setShowSplitAdvice(false);
  };

  window.addEventListener('bowlingFrameChanged', handleFrameChange);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('bowlingFrameChanged', handleFrameChange);
  };
}, []);
```

### Behavior
- ✅ Split notification appears when split is detected
- ✅ Notification automatically dismisses when frame changes
- ✅ User can still manually dismiss with "Dismiss" button
- ✅ Clean UI as player progresses through frames

---

## Change #3: ✅ Updated Split Patterns List

### Issue
- Had too many split patterns (20+)
- Included uncommon splits that weren't universally recognized
- User requested specific list of well-known splits

### Solution

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/utils/splitDetection.js`

#### Removed Splits
❌ 4-6 Split
❌ 4-6-7 Split
❌ 4-6-10 Split
❌ 7-8-9-10 (Greek Church - old)
❌ 8-10 Split
❌ 7-9 Split
❌ 5-6 Split
❌ 9-10 Split
❌ 4-5 Split
❌ 1-7 Split
❌ 1-10 Split
❌ Many other less common variations

#### New Split Patterns (User-Specified List)

##### 1. Baby Split
- **Pins**: 2-7 or 3-10
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Conversion Rate**: 65-68%
- **Note**: Generally the easiest splits to convert

##### 2. Big Four (Golden Gate / Big Ears)
- **Pins**: 4-6-7-10
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 2.1%
- **Note**: Four corner pins remaining

##### 3. Big Five (Greek Church)
- **Pins**: 4-6-7-9-10 (right-handed) or 4-6-7-8-10 (left-handed)
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 1.5%
- **Note**: Five pins with gaps between them

##### 4. Goal Posts (Bed Posts)
- **Pins**: 7-10
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 0.5%
- **Note**: The most infamous and difficult split

##### 5. Cincinnati
- **Pins**: 4-7-10 (left-handed) or 6-7-10 (right-handed)
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 2.8-3.2%
- **Note**: Three-pin triangle

##### 6. Dime Store
- **Pins**: 5-10
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Conversion Rate**: 24.8%

##### 7. Woolworth
- **Pins**: 5-7
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Conversion Rate**: 25.4%

##### 8. Sour Apple (Lily)
- **Pins**: 5-7-10
- **Difficulty**: Very Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 4.2%
- **Note**: Three pins in an arc

##### 9. Cocked Hat (Christmas Tree)
- **Pins**: 2-4-7, 3-6-10, or 4-7-8
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Conversion Rate**: 11.8-13.1%
- **Note**: Not always a true split (no pin always missing between them), but grouped with splits due to difficulty

### Updated Split Advice
Each split now includes:
- **Target Pin**: Which pin to aim for
- **Approach**: Detailed strategy for conversion
- **Difficulty**: Realistic assessment
- **Pro Tips**: 3-4 specific tips including conversion statistics

Example for Goal Posts (7-10):
```javascript
{
  targetPin: '7 or 10 pin',
  approach: 'The "Goal Posts" or "Bed Posts" - the most infamous split in bowling. Aim for the corner of your chosen pin and try to slide it across to hit the other. Use a straight ball with controlled power.',
  difficulty: 'Nearly impossible',
  tips: [
    'Choose which pin to target',
    'Position on opposite side from target',
    'Hit extremely thin to maximize slide',
    'Less than 1% conversion rate even for pros'
  ]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Pin Diagram SVG
- Uses Cubic Bézier curves for smooth, realistic pin shapes
- Darker stroke color (#1F2937) for better contrast
- Thinner stroke width (0.4) for cleaner appearance
- Adjusted viewBox remains 0 0 100 65 for compact display

### Event Handling
- Uses CustomEvent API for frame changes
- Clean event listener setup/teardown in useEffect
- Prevents memory leaks with proper cleanup

### Split Detection
- Maintains backward compatibility with `isSplit()` function
- `identifySplit()` returns matched pattern or generic object
- `getSplitAdvice()` provides default advice for unrecognized splits

## Testing Checklist

### Pin Diagram
- [ ] Navigate to Pin Carry page → Overview tab
- [ ] Verify pin 1 is at BOTTOM of diagram
- [ ] Verify pins 7-10 are at TOP of diagram
- [ ] Check pins look like bowling pins (not circles)

- [ ] Check color coding still works (red/blue gradients)

### Split Popup Dismissal
- [ ] Start pin-by-pin game entry
- [ ] Leave a split on first throw
- [ ] Verify split notification appears
- [ ] Complete the frame (make spare or leave pins)
- [ ] Advance to next frame
- [ ] Verify split notification AUTOMATICALLY disappears
- [ ] Test manual dismissal still works

### Split Patterns
- [ ] Leave Baby Split (2-7 or 3-10)
  - [ ] Verify notification shows "Baby Split"
  - [ ] Check difficulty shows "Easy"
