# UI and Database Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Navigation Tabs Cut Off ✅

### Problem
- **Social Hub**: Could only see tabs up to "Requests", remaining tabs were cut off
- **Admin Portal**: Could only see tabs up to "Settings", "Logs" tab was hidden
- Tabs were using `flex-1` which tried to fit all tabs equally, causing overflow on mobile

### Solution Applied

#### EnhancedFriendsPage.jsx (Social Hub)
```javascript
// Before: flex with flex-1 (equal width, causes cutoff)
<div className="flex space-x-1">
  <button className="flex items-center space-x-2 px-4 py-2...">

// After: scrollable flex with flex-shrink-0
<div className="flex space-x-1 overflow-x-auto scrollbar-hide pb-2">
  <button className="flex items-center space-x-2 px-3 sm:px-4 py-2... 
                     whitespace-nowrap flex-shrink-0">
```

**Changes:**
- Added `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling
- Added `scrollbar-hide` to hide scrollbar but keep functionality
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent tabs from shrinking
- Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Made padding responsive: `px-3` on mobile, `px-4` on larger screens
- Made text size responsive: `text-xs` on mobile, `text-sm` on larger
- Hide labels on very small screens: `hidden xs:inline sm:inline`

#### AdminPage.jsx (Admin Portal)
```javascript
// Before: flex with flex-1 (equal width, causes cutoff)
<div className="flex space-x-1 bg-charcoal-100 p-1 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <button className="flex-1 py-2 px-4...">

// After: scrollable flex with flex-shrink-0
<div className="flex space-x-1 bg-charcoal-100 p-1 rounded-lg mb-6 
                overflow-x-auto scrollbar-hide">
  <button className="flex-shrink-0 py-2 px-3 sm:px-4... 
                     whitespace-nowrap">
```

**Changes:**
- Added `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling
- Added `scrollbar-hide` class
- Changed from `flex-1` to `flex-shrink-0`
- Added `whitespace-nowrap`
- Responsive padding: `px-3` mobile, `px-4` desktop
- Responsive text: `text-xs` mobile, `text-sm` desktop
- Hide labels on small screens: `hidden xs:inline`
- Smaller icon spacing: `mr-1` mobile, `mr-2` desktop

#### index.css
Added scrollbar hiding utility:
```css
.scrollbar-hide {
  -ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE and Edge */
  scrollbar-width: none;      /* Firefox */
}

.scrollbar-hide::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;              /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
}
```

### Result
- ✅ All tabs visible and accessible on mobile
- ✅ Smooth horizontal scrolling to access all tabs
- ✅ No scrollbar visible (clean UI)
- ✅ Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- ✅ Icons-only mode on very small screens to save space

## Issue 2: Database Connection Timeout ✅

### Problem
- After running for a while, the app fails to connect to the database
- SQLite database becomes locked or unresponsive
- Concurrent requests causing database busy errors

### Root Cause
SQLite by default uses DELETE journal mode and has no busy timeout, which can cause:
- Database locks during concurrent access
- Timeouts when multiple requests try to access DB simultaneously
- Poor performance under load

### Solution Applied

#### database.js
Added comprehensive database optimizations:

```javascript
this.db = new Database(dbPath, { 
  verbose: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? console.log : null,
  timeout: 10000 // 10 second timeout for busy database
});

// Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
this.db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');

// Set busy timeout to handle concurrent access
this.db.pragma('busy_timeout = 10000');

// Optimize performance
this.db.pragma('synchronous = NORMAL');
this.db.pragma('cache_size = -64000'); // 64MB cache
this.db.pragma('temp_store = MEMORY');
```

#### What Each Setting Does:

1. **`timeout: 10000`**
   - Gives SQLite 10 seconds to acquire locks
   - Prevents immediate failures on busy database

2. **`journal_mode = WAL`** (Write-Ahead Logging)
   - **Most Important Fix**
   - Allows readers and writers to work simultaneously
   - Readers don't block writers, writers don't block readers
   - Prevents database locked errors
   - Creates `.db-wal` and `.db-shm` files (this is normal)

3. **`busy_timeout = 10000`**
   - Database will retry for 10 seconds if locked
   - Prevents "database is locked" errors

4. **`synchronous = NORMAL`**
   - Balances safety and performance
   - Still safe but faster than FULL mode

5. **`cache_size = -64000`**
   - 64MB memory cache for database pages
   - Reduces disk I/O
   - Improves read performance

6. **`temp_store = MEMORY`**
   - Stores temporary tables in memory
   - Faster temporary operations

### Result
- ✅ Database no longer locks under concurrent access
- ✅ Multiple users can read/write simultaneously
- ✅ 10-second timeout prevents immediate failures
- ✅ Better performance with memory caching
- ✅ More stable long-running connections

## Additional Fixes from Previous Session

### Mock Leaderboard Data Removed ✅
- Removed `generateMockLeaderboard()` function
- No more fake users (StrikeMaster, SpareQueen, etc.)
- Leaderboard shows only real users
- Empty state shown when no users exist

### Overflow Prevention ✅
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to body and html
- Added `overflow-hidden` to Layout component
- Cards constrained with `max-w-full`
- Prevents horizontal scrolling issues

# Restart all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check logs if needed
docker-compose logs --tail=50 frontend
docker-compose logs --tail=50 backend

## Issue 3: Modal Buttons Cut Off by Navbar 

### Problem
- When adding a ball or using other modals, the confirm/submit buttons at the bottom get cut off by the bottom navigation bar
- Users can't click the buttons to complete actions
- Affects all modals with action buttons at the bottom

### Solution Applied

#### Modal.jsx
Added bottom padding to the modal container and adjusted content height:

**Changes:**
- **Container Bottom Padding**: `pb-28` on mobile (accounts for navbar), `pb-0` on desktop
- **Modal Max Height**: Changed from fixed `90vh` to `calc(100vh-140px)` to account for navbar
- **Content Max Height**: Dynamic `calc(100vh - 280px)` ensures buttons are always visible
- **Desktop Unchanged**: Keeps same experience with `sm:pb-0` and `sm:max-h-[85vh]`

#### ArsenalPage.jsx (BallForm)
- Added `pt-4` for top spacing
- Added `pb-safe` class (padding + safe-area-inset-bottom)
- Ensures buttons have breathing room above navbar

### Result
-  All modal buttons fully visible on mobile
-  Navbar doesn't overlap buttons
-  Proper touch target spacing
-  Scrollable if modal is tall
-  Works on notched devices

## Issue 4: 403 Error When Switching In/Out of App

### Problem
- Users get 403 'Invalid or expired token' errors when switching back to the app
- Caused by visibility change detection triggering service worker updates
- Service worker updates caused API calls that failed with expired JWT tokens

### Root Cause
**registerSW.js** had a visibility change listener:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    registration.update(); // This triggered API calls
  }
});
```n
When users switched back to the app, it triggered update checks which made API calls. If the JWT token was expired, backend returned 403 and interrupted the user experience.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Removed Visibility Change Detection
**File:** `frontend/src/registerSW.js`
- Removed the `visibilitychange` event listener
- Kept the 30-second interval checks (less intrusive)
- Service worker updates now only happen:
  - Every 30 seconds (background)
  - On initial page load
  - When user navigates between pages

#### 2. Improved Error Handling
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/api.js`
- Enhanced response interceptor to handle both 401 and 403 (expired token) errors
- Added check for 'expired token' message in 403 responses
- Added protection to prevent redirect loop (don't redirect if already on login/register)
- Added console warning for debugging

**Before:**
```javascript
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
  window.location.href = '/login';
}
```n
**After:**
```javascript
if (error.response?.status === 401 || 
    (error.response?.status === 403 && error.response?.data?.error?.includes('expired token'))) {
  console.warn('Authentication failed - clearing session and redirecting to login');
  localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
  localStorage.removeItem('user');
  if (!window.location.pathname.includes('/login') && !window.location.pathname.includes('/register')) {
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
}
```n
### Result
-  No more 403 errors when switching in/out of the app
-  Service worker still checks for updates every 30 seconds
-  Better handling of expired tokens
-  No redirect loops
-  Cleaner user experience when session expires
