# Bowling App Updates - Part 2
## Date: October 1, 2025

## Summary of Changes

### 1. ✅ Removed Board Position References from Split Advice

**File Modified:** `frontend/src/utils/splitDetection.js`

**Changes:**
- Removed specific board position numbers (e.g., "Stand at board 35-40") from split advice
- Replaced with more general positioning guidance (e.g., "Position far left side", "Position on the left side")
- Makes advice more applicable to all bowlers regardless of their approach style

**Examples of changes:**
- `'Stand at board 35 (right-handed)'` → `'Position far left side'`
- `'Stand at board 20-25 (right-handed)'` → `'Position on the left side'`
- `'Stand center-right'` → `'Position center-right'` (kept general descriptions)

**Benefit:** Advice is now universally applicable and less confusing for beginners who may not understand board numbering systems.

### 2. ✅ Achievement Notifications Dismiss on New Frame

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/ui/AchievementToast.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/features/PinByPinEntry.jsx`

**Changes:**

#### AchievementToast.jsx:
- Added event listener for `bowlingFrameChanged` custom event
- Toasts automatically clear when frame changes
- Prevents notification clutter during active gameplay

#### PinByPinEntry.jsx:
- Dispatches `bowlingFrameChanged` event when advancing to a new frame
- Event includes frame number in detail for potential future use
- Only dispatches when actually moving to a new frame (not on throw changes within same frame)

**User Experience:**
- Achievement notifications appear when earned
- Automatically disappear when moving to the next frame
- Keeps the UI clean during active game play
- Users can still manually dismiss notifications if desired

### 3. ✅ Achievement System - Game Entry Processing & Progress

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/GameEntryPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/data/achievements.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/AchievementsPage.jsx`

**Changes:**

#### GameEntryPage.jsx:
- Added `achievementHandler` import and integration
- Achievements are now checked and awarded **only when games are saved**
- Achievement processing happens **after** successful game save to backend
- Ensures achievements are based on persisted data

```javascript
// Check and process achievements after game is saved
if (savedGame) {
  await achievementHandler.processGame(savedGame);
}
```

#### achievements.js:
- Added `howToAchieve` field to all achievements (sample shown for first 7)
- Provides clear, actionable guidance on how to earn each achievement
- Examples:
  - `first_strike`: "Knock down all 10 pins with your first ball in any frame"
  - `century_club`: "Complete a game with a total score of 100 or more points"
  - `perfect_game`: "Roll 12 consecutive strikes (strike in every frame including the 10th)"

#### AchievementsPage.jsx:
- Added display of `howToAchieve` in achievement detail modal
- Shows up in a purple info box when achievement is not yet earned
- Includes Target icon for visual clarity
- Hidden once achievement is earned (only shows "earned on" date)

**User Benefits:**
- ✅ Achievements only awarded when games are properly saved
- ✅ No duplicate or false achievement awards
- ✅ Progress updates correctly across multiple games
- ✅ Clear instructions on how to achieve each goal
- ✅ Better motivation through understanding requirements

### 4. ✅ Timezone-Consistent Date Storage

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/utils/dateUtils.js` - New utility module for date/time operations

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/utils/achievementEngine.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/GameEntryPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/features/PinByPinEntry.jsx`

**New Utility Functions in dateUtils.js:**

```javascript
getLocalISOString()         // Get current date/time in local timezone
getLocalDateString()        // Get current date (YYYY-MM-DD) in local timezone
toLocalISOString(date)      // Convert any date to local ISO format
formatLocalDate(date)       // Format date for display
formatLocalDateTime(date)   // Format date and time for display
getLocalStartOfDay(date)    // Get start of day in local timezone
getLocalEndOfDay(date)      // Get end of day in local timezone
isSameLocalDay(date1, date2) // Check if two dates are same day locally
getYesterday()              // Get yesterday's date
```

**Changes Made:**

#### achievementEngine.js:
- Import `getLocalISOString` utility
- Use local timezone for `dateEarned` when achievements are unlocked
- Ensures achievement dates match user's actual local time

#### GameEntryPage.jsx:
- Import `getLocalISOString` utility
- Use local timezone for `created_at` field when saving games
- Games are timestamped with user's local time, not UTC

#### PinByPinEntry.jsx:
- Import `getLocalISOString` and `getLocalDateString`
- Game date initialized with local date
- Date input max value uses local date
- Created timestamp combines selected game date with current local time

**Technical Details:**
- All dates now stored with timezone information
- ISO 8601 format with timezone offset (e.g., "2025-10-01T14:30:00+05:30")
- Backend receives dates with correct timezone context
- User's local time is preserved throughout the application

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Games appear with correct timestamp in user's timezone
- ✅ Achievement dates show accurate local time
- ✅ No confusion from UTC conversion
- ✅ Proper daily streak tracking
- ✅ Accurate "last played" timestamps
- ✅ International users see correct times

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Split Advice (No Board Positions)
- Navigate to Pin Carry page → Split Guide tab
- Verify no board position numbers appear (like "board 35" or "board 20-25")
- Check that positioning advice is general (e.g., "Position far left", "Move to opposite side")

### 2. Achievement Notifications Dismiss on Frame Change
- Start a pin-by-pin game entry
- Complete first frame to trigger any potential achievements
- Verify notification appears
- Advance to frame 2
- Verify notification automatically disappears

### 3. Achievements & Progress
- Complete and save a game
- Check that appropriate achievements are awarded
- View Achievements page - verify progress updates
- Click on unearned achievement
- Verify "How to Achieve" section appears with clear instructions
- Complete requirement and verify achievement unlocks

### 4. Timezone Dates
- Save a game and check the timestamp in game log
- Verify it matches your local time (not UTC)
- Check achievement earned dates in Achievements page
- Verify dates show your local time
- Test on different devices/timezones if possible
