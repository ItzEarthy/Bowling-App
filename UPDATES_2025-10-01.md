# Bowling App Updates - Achievement & Pin Carry Enhancements

## Date: October 1, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Achievement System Fixes

#### Issues Addressed:
- **Wrong achievements being awarded**: Fixed condition checking logic to properly handle different data formats
- **Achievements not updating**: Improved progress tracking and persistence

#### Changes in `achievementEngine.js`:

1. **Fixed `calculatePinsKnocked` method**:
   - Now handles both object format `{pins_knocked: n}` and simple number format
   - Properly calculates total pins across all frames

2. **Fixed `isCleanGame` method**:
   - Updated to handle both object and number formats in throws array
   - Correctly identifies games where all frames are strikes or spares

3. **Fixed `getConsecutiveStrikes` method**:
   - Properly detects consecutive strikes across an entire game
   - Handles both data formats correctly

4. **Improved `processGame` method**:
   - Now properly updates progress for incomplete achievements
   - Takes the maximum of existing progress or new progress to prevent regression
   - Ensures achievements are never marked as 100% complete unless earned

#### Result:
- Achievements now trigger correctly based on actual game data
- Progress tracking works properly across multiple games
- No more false positive achievements

### 2. Pin Carry Visualization - Pin Diagram Component

#### New Component: `PinDiagram.jsx`

Created a comprehensive visual pin diagram component that shows:

**Features:**
- Visual representation of all 10 bowling pins in standard layout
- Color-coded display based on hit/leave percentages
- Two separate diagrams for first and second throws
- Interactive legend showing color scale meanings

**Color Schemes:**
- **First Throw (Hit Frequency)**:
  - Red shades: High hit frequency (more often hit)
  - Yellow/Orange: Medium hit frequency
  - Light yellow: Low hit frequency
  
- **Second Throw (Leave Frequency)**:
  - Dark blue: High leave frequency (often left standing)
  - Blue/Light blue: Medium leave frequency
  - Very light blue: Low leave frequency

**Usage:**
```jsx
<DualPinDiagram
  firstThrowData={visualizationData.pin_diagram_data.firstThrow}
  secondThrowData={visualizationData.pin_diagram_data.secondThrow}
/>
```

#### Updated `pinCarryAnalysis.js`:

1. **Enhanced data tracking**:
   - Added `pin_hit_frequency`: Tracks how often each pin is hit on first throw
   - Added `pin_leave_frequency_by_pin`: Tracks how often each pin is left standing
   - Added `pin_spare_conversion`: Tracks spare conversion rate by pin

2. **New method `getPinDiagramData`**:
   - Calculates hit percentages for each of the 10 pins
   - Calculates leave percentages for each pin
   - Returns data formatted for the PinDiagram component

3. **Updated `recordFirstBall` method**:
   - Now tracks individual pin hits
   - Tracks individual pin leaves (remaining pins)
   - Properly stores data for visualization

#### Integration in `PinCarryPage.jsx`:
- Added pin diagram to the Overview tab
- Displays side-by-side comparison of first and second throw patterns
- Includes helpful explanation text for users

### 3. Comprehensive Split Reference Guide

#### Enhanced `splitDetection.js`:

**Updated `getSplitAdvice` function** with detailed information for each split:
- **Target Pin**: Which pin to aim for
- **Approach**: Detailed strategy for conversion
- **Difficulty**: Realistic assessment
- **Pro Tips**: 3-4 specific tips per split including:
  - Board positioning (for right-handed bowlers)
  - Angle and technique recommendations
  - Success rate information

**Coverage includes:**
- Famous splits (7-10, 4-6-7-10 "Big Four")
- Baby splits (2-7, 3-10)
- Common difficult splits (8-10, 7-9, 6-7-10)
- Single pin spares (10, 7, 4, 6)
- Multi-pin combinations (3-6-10, 2-4-5, etc.)

#### New Split Guide Tab in `PinCarryPage.jsx`:

**Features:**
1. **Introduction Card**:
   - Overview of the guide
   - Color-coded difficulty legend
   - Quick reference for conversion rates

2. **Comprehensive Split List**:
   - All splits from `SPLIT_PATTERNS` displayed with:

     - Exact pin numbers
     - Professional conversion rate percentages
     - Color-coded difficulty badges
     - Target pin identification
     - Detailed approach strategy
     - Pro tips as bullet points

3. **General Tips Section**:
   - Positioning advice
   - Ball speed recommendations
